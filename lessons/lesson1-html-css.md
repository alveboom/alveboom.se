# Lesson 1: practice with html and css

#### Goal: practice HTML and CSS basics

1. Create a new [codepen.io pen](https://codepen.io/pen/)

2. Create a page with a blue background (use the CSS property `background-color`) and big, white letters. Write something you think is realllllly funny.

3. Choose an GIF from [giphy.com](http://giphy.com) (you can use the search) and show it on your page (with the `<img src="...">` tag).

4. Create a link and put it around the image tag, so that when you click the image you go to the codepen.io url in which you made this website.

When you're done, send me a mail on eelke@boezeman.com with the url to the codepen, so I can check it out! If you get stuck (it doesn'tÂ work or you don't know how to do it), let me know.

Good luck!
Eelke
